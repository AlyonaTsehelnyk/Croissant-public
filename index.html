    <h1>ü•êCroissant</h1>

    <h2>
      The Croissant became the French national product in 1920. The Croissant
      started as a luxury product, but by the end of the nineteenth century, it
      was middle-class (the rich preferred a good brioche). Before the modern
      croissant, puff pastry was used as a garnish or shell, not to eat on its
      own.
